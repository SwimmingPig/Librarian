# Librarian
Full stuffs of Librarian app

this project is my software studio project with my teammates.
It's about helping people to search books that tehy want in the libraies.

The code is wrtten in react-native so u might need to build it in ur android phone.

p.s. I also provide the code which can be built in node.js, but there's two part: client side and server site, u might need to build them saperately if u want to run this project in node.js, good luck :)
